1. The purpose of this git repository is to have my work in a revision control system which allows me to add edit and share files easily

2. My favorite assignment was probably the MBTA assignment as it gave me intuition and skills surrounding a ubiquotous API


 3. I believe I have grown a great deal both in terms of conceptual intuition and general web dev knowledge


 4. The most important thing i learned in this course is that web dev is hard, finicky but ultimately really cool!

 5 I would like to delve into server side coding. I had a lot of trouble with the 2048 server implementation lab but I felt that once I got my head around it, the coding was actually very enjoyable.
